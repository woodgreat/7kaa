System Requirements

of Windows and Linux platforms is unstable.

* SDL 2.0.8 (http://libsdl.org/)
* enet 1.3.xx (http://enet.bespin.org/)
* OpenAL-soft or equivalent driver (http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html)

Optional dependencies
* Autoconf 2.65 (when using git snapshot)
* libcurl for full 7kfans multiplayer integration (website requires TLS1.2)
* gettext 0.19

  -> Packagers: Copy music into program data folder or PACKAGE_DATA_DIR
  -> Make sure the file names are in upper-case

Running locally from source build

To run the game from the build directory, you need to point to the game data
folder. The game data folder is set by the environment variable SKDATA. In
a bash shell, this can be accomplished by
